Hi, I'm Yufei! I am a BS/MS Computer Science student at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/). Currently, I am working on core machine learning and natural language processing problems with [Scott Geng](https://www.scottgeng.com/) under [Prof. Pang Wei Koh](https://koh.pw/), and building high-performance ML systems for serving large language models with [Megan Frisella](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mfris/) in the [SyFI Lab](https://syfi.cs.washington.edu/). Previously, Iâ€™ve worked on large-scale systems and infrastructure projects as a Software Engineering Intern at [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/yfzhang3) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).

Alongside my studies, I love to teach! I am a teaching assistant for [Machine Learning](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse446/25au/), where I help undergraduate and graduate students deepen their understanding of algorithms, optimization, and real-world applications.

Outside of academics, I like to stay active and curious:

* Training for my first Ironman 70.3 after three half marathons
* Hacking away at side projects
* Losing myself in Fredrik Backman novels that somehow make me laugh and cry on the same page

Most importantly, I always find time to spend with my loved ones, who remind me of how truly precious life is.
