Hi, I'm Yufei! I am a BS/MS Computer Science student at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/). I'm incredibly fortunate to be working on core machine learning and natural language processing problems with [Scott Geng](https://www.scottgeng.com/) and [Prof. Pang Wei Koh](https://koh.pw/). I'm also collaborating on distributed training with [Megan Frisella](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mfris/) in the [SyFI Lab](https://syfi.cs.washington.edu/).

Previously, I’ve worked on large-scale systems and infrastructure projects as a Software Engineering Intern at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yfzhang3) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).

Alongside my studies, I love to teach! I am a teaching assistant for [Machine Learning](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse446/25au/), where I help students deepen their understanding of algorithms, optimization, and real-world applications.

Outside of academics, I like to stay active and curious:

* Ran three half marathons; training for an Ironman 70.3
* Hacking away at side projects
* Losing myself in Fredrik Backman novels that somehow make me laugh and cry on the same page

Most importantly, I always find time to spend with my loved ones, who remind me of how truly precious life is.
