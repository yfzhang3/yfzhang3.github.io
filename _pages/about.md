Hi, I'm Yufei! I'm a **BS/MS Computer Science** student at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) with a focus on **machine learning, natural language processing, and building high-performance systems for serving large language models**.

Alongside my studies, I love to teach! I am a **teaching assistant** for **Machine Learning**, helping undergraduate and graduate students deepen their understanding of algorithms, optimization, and real-world applications.

Outside of academics, I like to stay **active** and **curious**:

* **Chasing my next finish line** (three half marathons and counting)
* **Hacking away at side projects**
* **Losing myself in novels** (Fredrik Backman somehow makes me laugh and cry on the same page)

Most importantly, I always find time to spend with my loved ones, who are a reminder of how truly precious life is.
