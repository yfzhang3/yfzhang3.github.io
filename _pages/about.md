Hi, I'm Yufei! I am a BS/MS Computer Science student at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/). Currently, I am working on core Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing problems with [Scott Geng](https://www.scottgeng.com/) under [Prof. Pang Wei Koh](https://koh.pw/) and building High-Performance Systems for serving Large Language Models with [Megan Frisella](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mfris/) in the [SyFI Lab](https://syfi.cs.washington.edu/).

Alongside my studies, I love to teach! I am a teaching assistant for [Machine Learning](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse446/25au/), where I help undergraduate and graduate students deepen their understanding of algorithms, optimization, and real-world applications.

Outside of academics, I like to stay active and curious:

* Chasing my next finish line (three half marathons and counting)
* Hacking away at side projects
* Losing myself in novels (Fredrik Backman somehow makes me laugh and cry on the same page)

Most importantly, I always find time to spend with my loved ones, who remind me of how truly precious life is.
